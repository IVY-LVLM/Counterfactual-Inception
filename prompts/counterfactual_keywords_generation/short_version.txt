First, identify and list the key descriptive keywords that accurately represent the elements visible in the provided image. Following this, create a set of counterfactual keywords for each descriptive keyword. These counterfactual keywords should be visually plausible yet not actually present or accurate in the context of the image. Ensure that the number of factual keywords matches the number of counterfactual keywords in each set, and that they correspond to each other.

Present the keywords in the following format, without additional explanations:

Factual Keywords: [_, _, , ...]
Counterfactual Keywords 1: [_, _, _, ...]
Counterfactual Keywords 2: [_, _, _, ...]
Counterfactual Keywords 3: [_, _, _, ...]
Counterfactual Keywords 4: [_, _, _, ...]
Counterfactual Keywords 5: [_, _, _, ...]
